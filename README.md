This project implements a **Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache** using a **Circular Doubly Linked List (CDLL)** and a **HashMap** for efficient key-value storage and retrieval. The cache supports `get` and `put` operations with **O(1) time complexity**, ensuring optimal performance. When the cache reaches its capacity, it automatically evicts the least recently used item. The implementation is available in both **Java** and **JavaScript**, with a web-based interface for interactive testing. Ideal for understanding caching mechanisms and optimizing memory usage in applications.
